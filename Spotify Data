--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle
--Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
);

--Then I inserted Spotify Data .csv into the table

--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL

--What are the top ten artists based on popularity 
SELECT id, artist_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

--What is the average duration, loudness, and energy by artist?
SELECT artist_name,
AVG(duration_ms),
AVG(loudness),
AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

--Which songs from this list received a popularity of at least 90?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >= 90
ORDER BY popularity desc;

--What was the average amount of tempo per artist?

SELECT artist_name, avg(tempo), popularity, id  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
